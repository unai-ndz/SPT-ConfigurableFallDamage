# Configurable Fall Damage

Let's you configure the SafeHeight and DamagePerMeter

The defaults of this mod give you a little more freedom without being broken.
Now jumping down a few steps will not break both your ankles and make you bleed.

Use SafeHeight: 999 to disable fall damage completely

SPT Defaults
- SafeHeight: 2.1
- DamagePerMeter: 11

This mod's defaults:
- SafeHeight: 4
- DamagePerMeter: 8
