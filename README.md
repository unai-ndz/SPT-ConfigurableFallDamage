# Configurable Fall Damage

Let's you configure the SafeHeight and DamagePerMeter

The defaults of this mod give you a little more freedom without being broken.
Now jumping down a few steps will not break both your ankles and make you bleed.

Use SafeHeight: 999 to disable fall damage completely

If using SPT Realism make sure this mod loads after it

SPT Defaults
- SafeHeight: 3
- DamagePerMeter: 9

SPT Realism Mod Defaults
- SafeHeight: 2.1
- DamagePerMeter: 11

This mod's defaults
- SafeHeight: 4
- DamagePerMeter: 8
